Namaste,

I am Nilesh Injulkar. I am from Kolhapur and live in Pune, Maharashtra, India.

I have been a **Software Engineer** for close to a decade now.
I mainly have worked as a Full Stack Developer with **Java** based stack.
You can find more details about my career at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/injulkarnilesh/). 


I like reading **books** especially biographies, but I keep exploring different genres. 
You can see what I plan to read or have read on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18638623-nilesh-injulkar) 

Free or working, you can find me rocking to **Classic Rock**. My playlists hosts Pink Floyd, Bon Jovi and Beatles and many other.

I am fond of **trekking**. I love visiting same or different forts nearby Pune with same or different people.

Other stuff I follow:
